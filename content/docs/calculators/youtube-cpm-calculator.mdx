## What is YouTube CPM?

**YouTube CPM** (Cost Per Mille) is the amount advertisers pay for one thousand ad impressions on YouTube videos. It's a key metric for YouTube creators to understand their potential earnings and optimize their content strategy.

## YouTube Earnings Formula

The YouTube earnings calculation formula is:

```
Earnings = (Views / 1,000) × CPM
```

Alternatively, for monetized views:
```
Earnings = (Monetized Views / 1,000) × CPM
```

### Formula Components

- **Views**: Total video views (or monetized views)
- **CPM**: Cost per thousand impressions that advertisers pay
- **1,000**: The multiplier (CPM is "per thousand")
- **Earnings**: Estimated revenue before YouTube's revenue share

## How to Use the YouTube Mondkalender

### Step 1: Enter Your Video Views

Input the number of views your video or channel has received.

**Example**: 100,000 views

### Step 2: Enter Your CPM Rate

Input your average CPM rate. Check YouTube Studio Analytics for your actual CPM.

**Example**: $5.00 CPM

### Step 3: Calculate

Click the "Calculate Earnings" button to get your estimated revenue.

**Result**: Earnings = (100,000 / 1,000) × $5.00 = **$500**

This is before YouTube's 45% revenue share, so your actual payout: $500 × 0.55 = **$275**

## YouTube CPM Examples

### Example 1: Finance Channel (High CPM)

- **Views**: 50,000
- **CPM**: $15.00
- **Gross Earnings**: (50,000 / 1,000) × $15 = **$750**
- **Creator Share (55%)**: $750 × 0.55 = **$412.50**

### Example 2: Gaming Channel (Medium CPM)

- **Views**: 200,000
- **CPM**: $3.50
- **Gross Earnings**: (200,000 / 1,000) × $3.50 = **$700**
- **Creator Share (55%)**: $700 × 0.55 = **$385**

### Example 3: Entertainment Channel (Low CPM)

- **Views**: 500,000
- **CPM**: $2.00
- **Gross Earnings**: (500,000 / 1,000) × $2 = **$1,000**
- **Creator Share (55%)**: $1,000 × 0.55 = **$550**

### Example 4: Education Channel (Very High CPM)

- **Views**: 30,000
- **CPM**: $20.00
- **Gross Earnings**: (30,000 / 1,000) × $20 = **$600**
- **Creator Share (55%)**: $600 × 0.55 = **$330**

## CPM vs RPM: Understanding the Difference

### CPM (Cost Per Mille)

```
CPM = (Advertiser Spend / Monetized Views) × 1,000
```

- What advertisers pay YouTube
- Gross revenue metric
- Before YouTube's revenue share
- Higher number

**Example**: CPM = $10.00

### RPM (Revenue Per Mille)

```
RPM = (Your Revenue / Total Views) × 1,000
```

- What creators actually earn
- Net revenue metric
- After YouTube's 45% cut
- After accounting for non-monetized views
- Lower number (typically 40-60% of CPM)

**Example**: RPM = $5.50

### CPM to RPM Conversion

**Typical Conversion**:
```
RPM ≈ CPM × 0.55 × Monetization Rate
```

**Example**:
- CPM: $10.00
- Monetization Rate: 80% (80% of views show ads)
- RPM: $10 × 0.55 × 0.80 = **$4.40**

### Why They Differ

**Factors Affecting CPM to RPM**:
1. **YouTube Revenue Share**: YouTube keeps 45%
2. **Ad Blockers**: 15-30% of viewers use ad blockers
3. **Skipped Ads**: Not all ads are viewed
4. **Demonetized Views**: Some views don't show ads
5. **Premium Members**: YouTube Premium pays differently
