## What is CPC?

**CPC** (Cost Per Click) is a digital advertising pricing model where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked. It's one of the most popular pricing models for search engine marketing and display advertising campaigns.

## CPC Formula

The CPC calculation formula is:

```
CPC = Total Ad Spend / Number of Clicks
```

### Formula Components

- **Total Ad Spend**: The total amount spent on your advertising campaign
- **Number of Clicks**: The total number of clicks your ad received
- **CPC**: The average cost you pay for each click on your ad

## How to Use the CPC Calculator

### Step 1: Enter Your Campaign Cost

Input the total amount you spent on your advertising campaign. This includes:
- Daily ad budget
- Weekly campaign spend
- Monthly advertising investment
- Lifetime campaign cost

**Example**: $500

### Step 2: Enter Total Clicks

Input the number of clicks your ad received during the campaign period.

**Example**: 1,000 clicks

### Step 3: Calculate

Click the "Calculate CPC" button to get your result.

**Result**: CPC = $500 / 1,000 = **$0.50**

This means you're paying $0.50 for every click on your ad.

## CPC Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Google Ads Search Campaign

- **Ad Spend**: $1,200
- **Clicks**: 800
- **CPC**: $1,200 / 800 = **$1.50**

### Example 2: Facebook Ad Campaign

- **Ad Spend**: $300
- **Clicks**: 600
- **CPC**: $300 / 600 = **$0.50**

### Example 3: LinkedIn Sponsored Content

- **Ad Spend**: $2,000
- **Clicks**: 400
- **CPC**: $2,000 / 400 = **$5.00**

| **CPA** | Cost / Conversions | Each conversion | Sales & signups |

## Common CPC Questions

### Q: What is a good CPC?

A: A good CPC depends on your industry and profit margins:
- **Below $1**: Excellent for most industries
- **$1-$3**: Good for e-commerce and services
- **$3-$5**: Average for competitive industries
- **Above $5**: Acceptable for high-value B2B or legal services

**Key Rule**: Your CPC should be lower than your profit per conversion.

### Q: How can I lower my CPC?

A: To reduce CPC:
1. Improve Quality Score (most effective)
2. Use long-tail keywords
3. Add negative keywords
4. Optimize ad copy and landing pages
5. Refine audience targeting
6. Test different ad formats
7. Increase your ad relevance score

### Q: Is lower CPC always better?

A: Not necessarily. Consider:
- **Conversion rate**: Cheaper clicks may convert poorly
- **Customer quality**: Higher CPC might attract better leads
- **Lifetime value**: Expensive clicks can be profitable if LTV is high
- **Competition**: Some industries naturally have higher CPC

**Example**:
- Campaign A: CPC $1, Conversion rate 1% = $100 per conversion
- Campaign B: CPC $3, Conversion rate 5% = $60 per conversion

Campaign B is more profitable despite higher CPC.

### Q: How does CPC relate to ROAS?

A: Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) is calculated as:

```
ROAS = Revenue / Ad Spend
```

For profitable campaigns:
```
CPC × Conversion Rate × Average Order Value > Ad Spend
```

**Example**:
- CPC: $2
- Conversion Rate: 5%
- Average Order Value: $100
- Cost per Sale: $2 / 0.05 = $40
- Profit: $100 - $40 = $60 per sale
- ROAS: $100 / $40 = 2.5 (250%)

## Advanced CPC Strategies

### 1. Bid Adjustments

Increase or decrease bids based on:
- **Device**: Mobile vs. Desktop vs. Tablet
- **Location**: High-converting geographic areas
- **Time**: Peak conversion hours
