## What is CPM?

**CPM** (Cost Per Mille or Cost Per Thousand) is a metric that represents the cost an advertiser pays for one thousand advertisement impressions on a web page. "Mille" is Latin for thousand.

## CPM Formula

The CPM calculation formula is:

```
CPM = (Total Ad Spend / Total Impressions) × 1,000
```

### Formula Components

- **Total Ad Spend**: The total amount spent on your advertising campaign
- **Total Impressions**: The number of times your ad was displayed
- **1,000**: The multiplier to calculate cost per thousand impressions

### Step 2: Enter Total Impressions

Input the number of times your ad was shown to users.

### Step 3: Calculate

## CPM Calculation Examples

- **Ad Spend**: $1,000

### Example 2: Google Display Network

- **Ad Spend**: $250
- **Impressions**: 100,000
- **CPM**: ($250 / 100,000) × 1,000 = **$2.50**

### Example 3: Instagram Sponsored Posts

- **Ad Spend**: $750
- **Impressions**: 300,000
- **CPM**: ($750 / 300,000) × 1,000 = **$2.50**
